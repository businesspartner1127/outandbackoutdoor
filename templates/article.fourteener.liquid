                    <p class="col-md-12">Right now, we’re looking for men’s, women’s and even kid’s gear! Over time we hope to able to purchase just about any outdoor gear but at the moment, the categories of outdoor gear that we can buy are: 1) outerwear (e.g., jackets, pants, apparel etc.), 2) tents and footprints (except rooftop tents), 3) sleeping bags, 4) camping gear excluding stoves and water filters, 5) packs and bags excluding wheeled luggage and 6) hiking gear. 7) Kids and Adult Cycling Gear (everything but the bike, helmet, &amp; pads). We cannot purchase protective gear of any kind including helmets and pads. We cannot purchase climbing gear of any kind (e.g., harnesses, rope, etc.). At this moment, we are not purchasing winter hardgoods like skis and snowboards but we will be soon!</p>

                    <p class="col-md-12">We call it our core five. 1) The Brand name; 2) the item or style name; 3) the item’s condition; 4) your name; and 5) email address. And...if you want to help make the sellback process extra special,  you can provide the item’s SKU or style number. If you’re having difficulties locating your item’s style name, don’t worry, we’re here to help. For assistance, email <u>buyback@outandbackoutdoor.com</u> and include your item’s details, including a picture of your item and we’ll help you figure it out. Note: upon finding the style name, all customers will still be required to submit a sell back request through the official submission process.</p>

Note: ownership of shipping may be your responsibility if you choose to receive an item back after it’s already been shipped to Out&amp;Back. Friendly reminder that you will need to provide your own packaging. *For oversized items, shipping ownership may vary between Out&amp;Back and the consumer.</p>

                    <p class="col-md-12">Our proprietary set of tools helps us evaluate important details like product condition, color, brand and maturity. We then compare these details against multiple retailers to present you with the most accurate and competitive offer in the market. In other words, we believe in fair offers for great gear. While each offer is customized, on average, offer prices for an used item in good condition is around 20% of the original retail price while new items being sold may garner closer to 30% of the original selling price. Again, many factors come into play when determining each offer.  </p>

                    <p class="col-md-12">Simple - Venmo or Paypal. Upon accepting our offer, you’ll be asked to provide your Venmo or Paypal ID which will allow us to seamlessly transfer payment to you upon final inspection of your item at our warehouse. Friendly tip: a separate account with the specified payment vendors is required in order for you to receive payment.</p>

                    <p class="col-md-12">This can happen… For example, you might have typed in the wrong item or style name by accident or there is an issue with a component on the item that you didn't notice, etc. When we inspect an item that is different from what the you originally submitted, one of three things can happen:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>1) <u>We make you another offer and you can choose to accept or decline:</u> sometimes, we’re still interested in buying the item even though it’s different from your original request. In this case, we’ll present you with a new offer that you can kindly accept or decline. If you accept, great! We pay you, you move on. If you decline and no longer want to sell it to us, then no hard feelings.</li>
                        <li>2) <u>We don't make you another offer and you want the item returned:</u> in some cases, the item is not something we can currently buy from you, thus aren’t able to make you another offer.</li>
                        <li>3) <u>If we don’t buy your item and you don't want it back, we donate it:</u> if we can't buy the item from you and you aren’t interested in keeping the item, we will gladly donate it on your behalf to one of our local partners who are in need of outdoor gear.</li>
